## [0.3.2] - 2025-12-29

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Fixed: Payment Method Selector Bypass
Resolved an issue where the `ReevitCheckout` component would bypass the payment method selection screen and auto-select 'card' when an `initialPaymentIntent` was provided. This fix ensures:
- The `ReevitCheckout` popup now correctly displays the payment method selector (e.g., Card, Mobile Money) when multiple options are available.
- The auto-advance logic is less aggressive, allowing users to make their selection within the popup.
- The composable no longer auto-selects a method if more than one is available in the `initialPaymentIntent`.

### 🚀 New Features

#### Added: Controlled Mode Support
The `ReevitCheckout` component now supports controlled mode for advanced use cases like Payment Links:

```vue
<template>
  <ReevitCheckout
    :isOpen="isCheckoutOpen"
    @openChange="isCheckoutOpen = $event"
    :initialPaymentIntent="paymentIntent"
    :publicKey="publicKey"
    :amount="amount"
    :currency="currency"
    @success="handleSuccess"
    @error="handleError"
    @close="handleClose"
  />
</template>
```

**New props:**
| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `initialPaymentIntent` | `PaymentIntent` | Pass a pre-created payment intent (skips internal initialization) |

#### Added: Public Payment Confirmation
The SDK now supports confirming payments via a public endpoint using a client secret, enabling anonymous payment link flows without authentication.

### 📦 Install / Upgrade

```bash
npm install @reevit/vue@0.3.2
# or
yarn add @reevit/vue@0.3.2
# or
pnpm add @reevit/vue@0.3.2
```

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
